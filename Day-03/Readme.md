**Operators**

1. Comparison Operators-
    - Loosely equal `(==)` type operator  is a comparison operator, in which javascript wants to prove both values true , so that it try to match left value to the closest value of right hand sides. so both of these comparison `5 == '5' or 0 == false` will be true...
  
    - strictly equal `(===)` type operator javascript tries to to compare left hand-side with right hand-side not only value but also their types . so these all `5 == '5' or 0 == false` will be false
